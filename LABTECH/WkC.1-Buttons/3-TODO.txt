DIGITAL CLOCK TO-DO LIST

0)Updates have been made to the Makefile to account for the stuff we
learned in our Makefiles lecture.  Look it over, try to understand
what is happening.

Note: the clock has *a lot* of library dependencies now.
In order for 'make depend' to run correctly, you
must first create a ".depend" file (it is a pre-requisite).
After running make depend to account for library dependencies,
you should be able to run 'make'.


USING REVISION CONTROL:

1) Run "mkdir RCS".

Before making changes to a file, check it in.  When you get the new
version working and are happy with what it does, check that one in.

Among other things, if you manage to screw something up, you can check
out the previous revision and be back to something that works.


CHANGES TO "clock.c":

2) add a character array with name like "title_text", and fill it with
   78 characters so it looks nice and has your name in it.  (We'll put
   it in the title bar later.)


3) Look at the "process_key()" and "stop_clock()" functions to see what
   they do.


4) starting the display is more complex.  Read the new controller code
   carefully to see what it does.

   (Note that you don't actually need those set_key_text() lines, I
   just put those in so you'd have an example to look at.  If you don't
   use the second row of keys, you should take those out.)


5) The loop that runs forever either uses pause(), or get_key(), to
   wait for a keystroke.
