LED CLOCK LAYOUT

Here is how the LEDs are laid out:

      ####    ####       ####     ####       ####     ####  
     #    #  #    #     #    #   #    #     #    #   #    #   AM
     #    #  #    #  #  #    #   #    #  #  #    #   #    # 
      ####    ####       ####     ####       ####     ####    PM
     #    #  #    #  #  #    #   #    #  #  #    #   #    # 
     #    #  #    #     #    #   #    #     #    #   #    #   24H
      ####    ####       ####     ####       ####     ####   

Digit 0 is on the left, and Digit 5 is the one on the right.


Each digit is laid out like this:

    2222 
   3    1
   3    1
    0000
   4    6
   4    6
    5555  7

The Most Significant Bit (MSB) is on the left.  So if you set
one of the digits to 0x80, you'll get just the decimal point.
If you set it to 0x01, you'll get only the center horizonal bar.


"Digit 7" is not really a digit: it's used for the colons and the
AM/PM/24H indicators.

The bit values are:

    24H indicator:   0x04
    AM indicator:    0x02
    PM indicator:    0x01

    upper-left dot:  0x80
    lower-left dot:  0x40
    upper-right dot: 0x20
    lower-right dot: 0x10

So, for example, setting digit 7 to "0xF2" would turn on all four dots
and illuminate the AM indicator.

Digit 6 is unused at this time.
