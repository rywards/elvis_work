The story so far:
In the beginning the Universe was created. This
has made a lot of people very angry and
been widely regarded as a bad move.
Many races believe that it was created by some
sort of God, though the Jatravartid people of
Viltvodle VI believe that the entire Universe
was in fact sneezed out of the nose of a being
called the great Green Arkleseizure.
