# check $1 does not equal $2

# check $1 has files in it

# Loop on all files in $1
#   1) if there is a file with same name in $2,
#      use "cmp -s" to see whether contents are the same
#      print result (either contents match or contents differ)
#   2) if there is no file with same name in $2, print message
