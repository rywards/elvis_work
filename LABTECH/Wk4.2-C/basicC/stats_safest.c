/* stats_safest.c - work around brittle input system
 *
 * D Provine 28 Jan 2014
 *
 * fgets() returns the next line of input, cutting it off if it's
 * longer than the size of the buffer being read.
 *
 * sscanf() does what scanf() does, but it works on a string that's
 * already been read in.  If something goes wrong, that string, in
 * program memory, can be examined with a debugger.
 *
 * To see this in, compile this program with "-g", and then
 * run it in GDB, type "q" or something, and when it loops hit
 * ^C.  Then try to examine the data with "print lineread".
 *
 * See also "stats_broken.c" and "stats_discard.c".
