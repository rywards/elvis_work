# Demonstrates how to use positional parameters with string subsitution
# ${variable:-word}  if the variable is non-existent or null (empty string)
# then this expression will replace the variable with the word

#Since positional parameters are always null if you didn't pass them in
#we have effectively set a "default" value for the second positional param
