# globalVar
# a simple script demonstating the difference between variable
# scoping in bash scripts.

# functions are easily defined in bash scripts (and in the shell itself)
# functions defined in a shell instance last only as long the current
# session (unless we include them in our .bash_profile or .bashrc files)
#  However those we define inside scripts have a bit more permanence

# variables defined inside a function are NOT local unless specifically
# designated as such.  All variables are global otherwise.
function simpleFunction(){
    var1="var1:  inside function" 
    echo $var1
}

var1="var1:  outside function" #initialize var1
echo $var1 
simpleFunction #simpleFunction assigns a value to the var1
echo $var1 # the value has been changed
