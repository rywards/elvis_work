#Modification of sample script from Learning the Bash Shell, 3rd. Ed, Task 4-1
# Jake Levy
# Apr 2019


#Demonstrates a basic use of the postional Parameters
# and the difference between the postional params for
# the script itself and for functions and scoping of
# positional parameters

# like the script itself, functions have their own local set of postional
# parameters.  These are NOT the same as those in the overall script
function simpleFunction(){
    echo $1  #echo positional 1 parameter of function

    echo $2
    
    echo "Albums Artist"
     echo $0
}
 simpleFunction $1
 sort $1 -k1rn,1 | head #use the value of script positional parameter as input
 echo $0
 echo $2
 #$0 is always the name of the script, even if used inside a function, try it

 #you can check for functions defined in your shell session with
 # declare -f (with their definition)
 # or
 # declare -F (without their definition)
