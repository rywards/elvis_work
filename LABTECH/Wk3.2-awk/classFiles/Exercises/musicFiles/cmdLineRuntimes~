#a file for finding all songs in finalMusicOut.txt, under len minutes,
# where len is passed in as a command line variable

# NOTE: Any variable in an awk file that has not been explicitly defined
#  is automatically 0, unless  it is given an initialization value on the
# command line, with the -v flag.

# USAGE EXAMPLE: ./cmdLineRuntimes -v len=6 finalMusicOut.txt
# The example above will find all all songs that are less than 6 minutes
# in length.
# If you run this code without passing in a value for len, then len is 0
# and only the title line will print.
