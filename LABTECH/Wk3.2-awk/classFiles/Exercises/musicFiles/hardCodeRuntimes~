#a file for finding all songs in finalMusicOut.txt, under len minutes
# where len is any integer
#Usage:  ./hardCodeRuntimes finalMusicOut.txt

# NOTE: Variable definitions must be inside some instruction block
# if not passed in via the -v flag (only available to command line awk)
# Here I defined it in a BEGIN block, so it is set before anything is read
# But it could also be defined in the (NR>1) block.

# If you place anything  outside of a block, the code will still work but
# awk will think you are defining a *pattern*.
# Trivial patterns (like an assignment) will match all lines (or at least
# lines that you do not intend to match).
# So you will see some confusing results (your intended output mixed
# with unintended output)..

BEGIN{len = 5}
(NR==1){
    printf("%20s\t%10s\n",$1, $5)
}

(NR > 1){


    orig = $0 # store the original record

   
    FS=":"    #update input field separator to split the 5th column
    $0 = $5;  #Re-set record to be the 5th column (minutes:seconds)
    
     if ($1 < len){  #$1 grabs the first part of 5th column

	 FS="\t";    #reset the field separator
	 $0 = orig;  #re-read the original line
	print $1, "\t", $5  #print the first (Name)  and
	                    # fifth (Runtime) columns
     } else{
	 FS = "\t"
