/* MODEL */

/* Set up an interval timer for our clock.
 * This is the "Model" of "Model-View-Controller"; it's what
 * actually measures real time passing.
 *
 * The interval timer is provided by the operating system.
 * We specify an interval, and when that much time has passed,
 * the system will send our process an alarm signal, which
 * is named SIGALRM.  It is a repeating timer, so we will
 * get the signal every however-long-the-interval-is seconds,
 * until we turn it off or the program ends.
 *
 * This code specifies that the action which should happen
 * when we get an alarm is to run the "tick()" function, which
 * is part of the Controller module for this project.
 *
 * NO CHANGES NEED TO BE MADE TO THIS FILE.
