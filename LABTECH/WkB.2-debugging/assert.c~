/* assert.c -- show assertions
 *
 * NOTE: assert() is a macro, not a function!
 *       Assertions may not contain string literals!
 *
 * You can turn assertions off by compiling with '-DNDEBUG' as a
 * compiler flag.  So once your program is working, add that to
 * your Makefile, "make clean ; make" will rebuild without the
 * assertions.
 *
 * Do not take assertions out of your code; just add '-DNDEBUG'
 * to CFLAGS in the Makefile.  That way, if a bug you didn't know
 * about is reported, you can turn the assertions back on.
