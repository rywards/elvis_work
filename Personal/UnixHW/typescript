My preferred name is Ryan
My pronouns are he/his/him
The most fun thing about computer science is just being able to do literally anything with the computer, if we can code it
The most interesting thing about being a computer science student is learning how a computer really works, and learning the different ways to manipulate it into doing whatever we want.
The most irritating thing about being a cs student is when I can't solve a problem. It aggravates me to no end.
I like to work on cars, I like to play video games, I'm a bit of a foodie as well.
My favorite book to read has probably been either 1984 or "One Last Great Thing: A Story of a Father and a Son, a Story of a Life and a Legacy" by John Burke.
I visited Nashville, TN in 2017 by driving there. It was a lot of fun being on the road that long and seeing a lot of the country in one go.
