Hate
----

assembly: lots of difficult detailed stuff to keep
	track of, esp registers

GameMaker: hard to merge code written as text with
	code written as visual blocks

Java: makes you use classes
Java: 64-bit booleans

Python: indentation rather than curly braces

Python: hides how expensive operations are

Java: have to build a whole factory just to get
	something to work

C++: more difficult to learn the syntax than Java

Java:  not good beyond the learning stage
	complicated, lots of overhead
	not as efficient as other languages

JavaScript: lots of different frameworks

SageMath: harder to use than Python 3

Languages that hide what's going on behind the scenes

C: Closer to the machine - have to work with a lot
	of the detail of what's going on
C: have to be careful not to mess something up
